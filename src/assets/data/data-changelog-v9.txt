- Fixed various errors in new raw data file
  - Incorrect decimal signs, missing parentheses, quotes et cetera
  - Some empty lists were mistakenly entered as [""] - this caused crashes
  - Three projects had empty locations - adding placeholder ["missing"] works for now

- Some projects had locations not used before. I added those places to 'project_coordinates.json'
